# Marketing Dataset Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This was my second project using Python. Rather than build a piece of software, my objective with this project was to
learn about and demonstrate my experience and interest in using Python for the cleaning and analysis of datasets.

I grabbed this dataset from Kaggle. I chose a marketing related dataset in particular because of my interest in 
applying Python and my data analysis skills to uncover insights in a business context. Using Python and various modules,
 I manipulated the dataset into various dataframes and created a variety of visualisations to clarify details regarding 
the business' marketing and sales performance, as well as relationships between different areas.

For example, I used a linear regression model for the number of in-store purchases in order to determine parts of the 
dataset which correlated most closely in affecting the number of in-store purchases. I then used Shapley Additive 
Explanations (SHAP) to provide further detail on which values had the most impact on the linear regression's prediction.

## Main Modules Used
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Plotly Express
* SHAP
* scikit-learn
