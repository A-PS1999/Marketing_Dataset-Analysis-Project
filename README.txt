Marketing Dataset Analysis Project

WHAT'S THE GOAL BEHIND THIS PROJECT?
This is my second Python project. Unlike my last, where I created a piece of software for the analysis of various Search Engine Optimization (SEO) elements of a URL and website, this project is intended for me to show my familiarity with a number of modules related to data manipulation, analysis and visualisation. It is also intended to show my interest in finding opportunities (hopefully paying ones!) to engage in the field of marketing and related analysis.

SO WHAT DID YOU DO?
I grabbed a dataset from Kaggle.com, an excellent site for finding csv files and datasets on a wide variety of topics to analyse. Given my aforementioned interest, I picked a good looking marketing related dataset.

By using Python and useful modules like pandas, matplotlib, plotly and scikit-learn, I fed this dataset into various dataframes and manipulated it as necessary to create a variety of different visualisations (plots like bar charts, boxplots) which help clarify various details regarding the business' marketing and sales performance.

I used scikit-learn to create a linear regression model for the number of in-store purchases in order to try find out which features of the dataset correlated most closely in affecting the number of in-store purchases. I then used a module to try explain and understand more about the results of my linear regression, namely the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) module.
